Wakoma works with our partners to build community-based wireless mesh networks that provide free or low-cost access to the internet and local offline content and services. Our aim is to make it easier for organizations to seed new networks in places where internet is unavailable, expensive, unreliable, or censored.

The Nimble is a completely open source solution for starting a new network, or expanding an existing one. 

Five people or five hundred, users can video and voice chat, text, share files, take courses, build and view websites, stream media, view global maps, create documents and spreadsheets, read e-books, play games, and much more, completely offline.

If a single internet connection is available, it can be plugged into the Nimble to provide free or paid internet access to anyone on the network.  The offline services and content are always available, regardless of internet availability.

Anyone can build their own Nimble with locally sourced hardware and 3D-printed components from local maker spaces and fab-labs.

Potential applications:

    Disaster response
    COVID-19 Shutdowns
    Circumvention of censorship and surveillance
    Portable Homelab
    Remote schools and community centers

 

We are always looking for collaborators and partners, especially those working on bringing the next 3.6 billion online. Ping info@wakoma.co.
